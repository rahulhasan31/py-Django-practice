 python manage.py migrate
```

5-Create a Superuser (Admin Account):

You can create an admin superuser account to access the Django admin interface for managing your site. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

This will start the server, and you can access your Django project in your web browser at http://localhost:8000/.

Your Django project is now set up and running. You can start building your web application by defining models, views, templates, and URLs. The project's main settings are in the settings.py file within your project directory.
